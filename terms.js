                <h2>Common Provisions</h2>
                <h3>No Waiver</h3>
                <p>
                    The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms does not mean a waiver of that right or provision. No waiver will be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.
                </p>

                <h3>Service Interruption</h3>
                <p>
                    To ensure the best possible service, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates, or any other changes, informing Users appropriately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or terminate the Service altogether. If the Service is terminated, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data or information in accordance with applicable law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Owner shall not be liable for any failure to perform or delay in performance of any obligation under these Terms if such failure or delay is caused by events beyond the Owner’s reasonable control (“Force Majeure Events”). Force Majeure Events include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, civil commotion, governmental actions, strikes, lockouts, labour disputes, epidemics, pandemics, fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, infrastructure breakdowns, blackouts, or interruptions in telecommunications or internet services. In such cases, the Owner’s obligations will be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, and the Owner will not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from such events.
                </p>

                <h3>Service Reselling</h3>
                <p>
                    You may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any portion of these Services without the Owner’s express prior written permission, granted either directly or through a legitimate reselling programme.
                </p>

                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    To learn more about the use of your Personal Data, please refer to the <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> of these Services.
                </p>

                <h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trade mark rights, patent rights, and design rights related to these Services are the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are protected by applicable laws or international treaties relating to intellectual property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All trade marks — nominal or figurative — and all other marks, trade names, service marks, word marks, illustrations, images, or logos appearing in connection with these Services are, and remain, the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are protected by applicable laws or international treaties related to intellectual property.

                <h3>Changes to these Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at any time. In such cases, the Owner will inform you of these changes by publishing the updated Terms on this webpage and by announcing the changes publicly in the community's Discord server. Additional notifications (such as email or in-app messages) may also be used where appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such changes will only affect the relationship with you for the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your continued use of the Service after a change will mean you accept the revised Terms. For significant changes, we will provide reasonable advance notice—such as via Discord announcement—before the changes take effect. If you do not wish to be bound by the changes, you must stop using the Service before the new Terms become effective. Failure to accept the revised Terms may entitle either party to terminate the Agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to your acceptance. You can obtain any previous version from the Owner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If required by applicable law, the Owner will specify the date by which the modified Terms will enter into force.
                </p>

                <h3>Assignment of Contract</h3>
                <p>
                    The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these Terms, taking your legitimate interests into account. Provisions regarding changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms in any way, without the written permission of the Owner.
                </p>

                <h3>Severability</h3>
                <p>
                    Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which will remain in full force and effect. Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed, and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable, and consistent with its original intent. These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                </p>

                <h3>Governing Law and Venue of Jurisdiction</h3>
                <p>
